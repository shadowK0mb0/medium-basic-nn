# Basic Neural Network setup with Comments

## Notebook (interactive)

For an interactive explanation, view the jupypter notebook `basic_nn.ipynb`. All steps should be clear and well documented, but you can also check out my blog post for further explanation!

## Script

This is a script you can run via `main.py` to train a simple model on FashionMNIST. The dataset can be downloaded via the script in the notebook, or from [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist#get-the-data) and stored in `data/FashionMNIST/raw`
